It is impossible to imagine the modern world without technology. Every day we use smartphones, computers and the Internet without even thinking about how much they have changed our lives. But what does the future hold? Scientists and engineers are working on the creation of artificial intelligence, which will be able to solve tasks faster and more efficiently than humans. Already now machines are learning to diagnose diseases, drive cars and even write music. However, with the development of technology, new questions arise: how to preserve privacy? Will machines become a threat to humanity? The future depends on how we use these tools. Perhaps in 50 years we will live in a world where robots will be our assistants and virtual reality will replace travel. Or we may face new challenges that we cannot yet predict.
